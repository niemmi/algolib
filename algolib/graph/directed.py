"""Directed graph that doesn't have multi-edges but may contain loops.
Both vertices and edges may have associated properties. Vertices as stored
as an adjacency matrix using dicts and as a separate dict that maybe iterated
over.

Time complexity of the operations:
- check if edge (x, y) exists: O(1)
- check degree of vertex: O(1)
- insert/delete edge: O(1)
- insert vertex: O(1)
- delete vertex: O(number of connected edges)
- iterate vertices/edges: O(n)

Interface is loosely based on NetworkX (http://networkx.github.io/).
