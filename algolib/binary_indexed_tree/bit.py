"""Binary indexed tree, supports point updates and range sum queries
in O(log n) time. Note that BIT uses 1-based indexing so for all the
operations that take index as argument 1 is the minimum value. It should also
be noted that when BIT is generated the first item in the given sequence is
discarded.

Time complexity of the operations:
- creation: O(n)
- point query: O(log n)
- range query: O(log n)
- point update O(log n)
